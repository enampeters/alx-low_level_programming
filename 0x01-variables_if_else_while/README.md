5-print_numbers.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6-print_numberz.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7-print_tebahpla.c prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
8-print_base16.c  prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
9-print_comb.c prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
100-print_comb3.c creates all possible different combinations of two digit numbers
101-print_comb4.c generates all possible different combinations of 3 digit numbers.
102-print_comb5.c generates all possible different combinations of double digit numbers.
